		<h2>Place of Birth</h2>
			<p>I was born and raised in Champaign, Illinois. I moved to Idaho when I was in first grade.
			I had to retake first grade again, but living in Idaho is great.</p>
			
		<h2>Education goals</h2>
			<p>I want to get a degree in software development. I am leaning towards game design, and with the
			knowledge I gain from coding programs, and websites can help further my goal of being a 
			game designer.</p>
		
		<h2>Attitude</h2>
			<p>I am a fairly optomistic kind of person. I do my best, and when the going gets rough,
			I ask for help. I tend to keep an upbeat attitude, and let my anger go out calmly by relaxing.</p>
		
		<h2>Academic Achievements</h2>
			<p>I managed to be the only clairinet in jazz band, obtained good grades in high school, and
			did marching band.</p>
