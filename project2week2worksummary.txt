Time of completion 4 hours

1st hour
Was starting out great, feeling like I could figure this out easily

2nd hour
Started having issues with the site not linking with database, made a thank you page to help with this

3rd hour
was getting flustered on why the database was not connecting, looking up guides and the ejdesign to see what I was doing wrong

4th hour
copied the data from example site and the code worked and had no trouble.
